%   dscatter2_TACWrapper( code was extracted from DSCATTER function
%   DSCATTER creates a scatter plot coloured by density.
%
%   DSCATTER(X,Y) creates a scatterplot of X and Y at the locations
%   specified by the vectors X and Y (which must be the same size), colored
%   by the density of the points.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'MARKER',M) allows you to set the marker for the
%   scatter plot. Default is 's', square.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'MSIZE',MS) allows you to set the marker size for the
%   scatter plot. Default is 10.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'FILLED',false) sets the markers in the scatter plot to be
%   outline. The default is to use filled markers.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'PLOTTYPE',TYPE) allows you to create other ways of
%   plotting the scatter data. Options are "surf','mesh' and 'contour'.
%   These create surf, mesh and contour plots colored by density of the
%   scatter data.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'BINS',[NX,NY]) allows you to set the number of bins used
%   for the 2D histogram used to estimate the density. The default is to
%   use the number of unique values in X and Y up to a maximum of 200.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'SMOOTHING',LAMBDA) allows you to set the smoothing factor
%   used by the density estimator. The default value is 20 which roughly
%   means that the smoothing is over 20 bins around a given point.
%
%   DSCATTER(...,'LOGY',true) uses a log scale for the yaxis.
%
%   Examples:
%
%       [data, params] = fcsread('SampleFACS');
%       dscatter(data(:,1),10.^(data(:,2)/256),'log',1)
%       % Add contours
%       hold on
%       dscatter(data(:,1),10.^(data(:,2)/256),'log',1,'plottype','contour')
%       hold off
%       xlabel(params(1).LongName); ylabel(params(2).LongName);
%
